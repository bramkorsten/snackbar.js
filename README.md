### Snackbar
Snackbar is a barebones notification handler for the web. It runs using only one command, and never needs to be looked at again!
Simply add snackbar.js and snackbar.css to your site, and call it by using `snackbar.success(msg)` or `snackbar.error(msg)`. And thats it! Snackbar will automatically show your notification to the user for 5 seconds, and the user can dismiss a notification at any given time.
